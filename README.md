========================

project 1
-----------------------
Counting different elements in sequence.
But the space limitating is O(lg n)

data scale:
> 50
> 
> 50,000
> 
> 5,000,000,000

answer requirement: computing cost



project 2
-----------------------
packing n rectangles with (len, wid) into a large rectangle(LEN, WID)
required to use polynomial time algorithm to solve it

data scale:
> not claimed

answer requirement:
> minimum LEN*WID
> 
> minimun 2*(LED + WID)
>
